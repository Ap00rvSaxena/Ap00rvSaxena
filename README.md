## Hello, Visitor ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ˜„ My name is Apoorv Saxena (He/Him)

<p>ðŸ’¬ I am a recent graduate student from The University of Texas at Arlington. I tend to do multiple personal projects of my own on technologies like Deep Learning, Web Development, Full Stack Development, IoT, and Data Science to learn all these new technologies which I share righ here on this platform. Currently, I am looking forward to a Full-time opportunity starting immediately in a growing organization and forge a career.</p>

<p>âš¡ In my free time, I like to do gyming, running, play soccer or CSGO, or just wander aimlessly over the world wide web.</p>
